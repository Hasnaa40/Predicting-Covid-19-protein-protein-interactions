# Predicting-Covid-19-protein-protein-interactions 
## Building a complete site that is used to predict whether a protein sample will bind to the covid-19 proteins or not using ML & DL 

* In this project, an Biopython protein-mapping method and AVL tree mapping method were proposed to predict the interactions of non-structural proteins belonging to COVID-19 with other human proteins 
* data collected from the BioGrid dataset. 
>  In phase 1 
* we mapped the data using protein analysis package called (BioPython)  , and the data normalized using z-score ,then the data is classified it with random forest which gave us 99.33% accuracy ,98.2% with SVM classifier  and 87.8% with Logistic Regression classifier . 
> In phase 2 
* we mapped data using AVL tree we managed to apply non physiochemical feature extraction (AVL) , protein sequence represented as a numeric representation according to each amino acid depth in AVL , then these sequence classified by RNN  (BiRNN) and get 99.58% accuracy which is a great for algorithm-based mapping method.
* Compared to experimental methods, computational methods are time efficient and can analyze the protein interactions with less equipment. Furthermore, with the recent development of technology, protein sequence information can be obtained easily
